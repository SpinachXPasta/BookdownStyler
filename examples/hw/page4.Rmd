## Question C (35 pts)
We want to investigate and visualize the diamonds data!
A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds is included in R ggplot2 package, including carat, color, clarity, cut, total depth, table, depth, width, height and price.

![](https://caleb-huo.github.io/teaching/2017FALL/HW/HW2/diamond.png)


You need to install the ggplot2 package first.
The load the diamonds data in R by:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
```
For details, check ?diamonds.
There are total `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds, and **we will only work on the subset of diamonds** with the best clarity (clarity == "IF").
```{r}
diamonds.subset <- subset(x = diamonds, subset = clarity == "IF")
```
This will reduce to `r nrow(diamonds.subset)` diamonds. Again, **only work on diamonds.subset**
throughout this question, you are required to use **ggplot() function** to generate figures.

#### 1. Draw scattered plot of carat (x-axis) versus price (y-axis). Use the color variable as the color aesthetic mapping (5 pts)
```{r}
## Your code
ggplot(data=diamonds.subset) + geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color))
```

#### 2. Based on question 1, wrap the figures by color (5 pts)
You will end up with 7 sub-figures, with each sub-figure representing the scattered plot of carat versus price for a color.
Any facet style is OK.

```{r}
## Your code
ggplot(data=diamonds.subset) + geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color)) + facet_wrap(~color)

```


#### 3. Based on question 1, use the volumn ($x\times y \times z$) as the size aesthetic mapping (5 pts)
Also, label the point with the largest carat value within each color group as **H-Color** using red color.
For example, if the color is D, label the point as **H-D** with red color in the figure, etc.
If there are multiple maximums, you can either mark one of them, or mark all of them.

```{r}
## Your code


diamonds.subset.highest <- diamonds.subset %>%
  mutate(volume = x*y*z) %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  filter(volume == max(volume)) %>%
  mutate(label = paste0("H-",color, " (",carat,",",price,")"))

ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color, size = x*y*z), data=diamonds.subset) + 
  geom_text_repel(aes(x = carat, y = price, 
                        label = label),                                                         box.padding   = 1.5, 
                        point.padding = 0,
                        segment.color = 'grey50',
                        color = "red",
                        data=diamonds.subset.highest)
```


#### 4. Based on question 1, add a smooth curve fitting to the scattered plot by group. (5 pts)
Hint: geom smooth, you can just use the default option.
```{r}
## Your code
ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = color),data=diamonds.subset) + geom_point() +geom_smooth( se = FALSE, linewidth = 0.5)

```

#### 5. Investigate the price/carat ratio by color. (5 pts)
Create boxplot of price/carat ratio by color.
Use color variable as the color aesthetic mapping.
Also put jittered dots on top of the boxplot, and set the transparent level of the jittered dots as 0.5. 

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = color, y = price/carat, color = color),data=diamonds.subset) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(alpha=0.5)
```

#### 6. Draw histogram of the price, fill by cut (aesthetic option), wrap by color (5 pts)
Use black white (bw) theme. The price value (i.e., the number on  the x-axis) should be vertical instead of the default horizontal.  


```{r}
ggplot(aes(x = price, fill = cut),data=diamonds.subset) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip() + facet_wrap(~color) + theme_bw() + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank())

```


#### 7. Draw barplot of color count, fill by cut (aesthetic option). Also use position="dodge" such that within each color, different cuts will be placed side by side. (5 pts)
Also, you need to flip x-axis and y-axis for this barplot.
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds.subset, aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + coord_flip()
```


## Note (5 pts):


### Homework should be uploaded to courseweb:
1. Don't forget to write your name in this HW (E.g., Name:XXX).
1. Save your compiled result as html file. Rename the file name as: hw2_Lastname_Firstname.html.
2. Don't forget to write your name on the top of the html file.
3. RMD file is not required. You only need to upload the html file to the [e-leaning](https://elearning.ufl.edu) website.

### If you generate a figure, please write appropriate figure title, labels, legend if necessary. 

### If your code is not intuitive, please write comments to make the code readible.
