## Question B (45 pts)
The Iris flower data set <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set> is a multivariate data set introduced by the famous statistician Ronald Fisher.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.

Iris data is available in R data(iris), with total `r nrow(iris)` samples.
Please answer the following questions:

#### 1. Calculate the mean of Petal.Length by Species (5 pts). 

```{r}
## your code
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarise("Average Petal Length" = mean(Petal.Length))

```

#### 2. For each of the four features (i.e., Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width), calculate the mean value by species. (5 pts)
(Hint: use group_by and summarize_all). 

```{r}
## your code
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarise_all(mean)


```


#### 3. For each of the four features, calculate the difference between maximum value and the minimum value  (5 pts)
The results will be a vector of four elements (naturally ordered by 1. Sepal.Length, 2. Sepal.Width, 3. Petal.Length and 4, Petal.Width).

```{r}
## your code
apply(iris[,-5],2,function(x){max(x) - min(x)}) #%>%unname() #uncomment to returned unnamedvector

```






#### 4. Divide each of the four features by the maximum value of the feature. (5 pts)
We end up with a matrix of the same dimension (`r dim(iris[,-5])`) as the original matrix but after this standardization step, all values range between 0 and 1. 
Use the sweep() function. 
Only print the first 6 rows of your result.



```{r}
## your code
sweep(iris[,-5],2,apply(iris[,-5],2,max),"/") %>% as.matrix() %>% head()

```

#### 5.Correlation heatmap (5 pts)
For each pairs of samples, calculate their Pearson correlation using cor() function. (Try to see if you can avoid loops.). 
You will get a `r nrow(iris)` by `r nrow(iris)` matrix.
Visualize the correlation matrix by heatmap.
In the correlation heatmap, keep the same sample order as the original data matrix.
Avoid your function automatically standardizes each row to mean 0 and sd 1.
Correlation heatmap is a good diagnostic tool to visualize the similarity among samples.
The diagonal lines have correlation 1 since these are samples' correlation with themselves.
From this figure, you can see which two species are more similar.



```{r}
## your code
cor_df <- cor(t(iris[-5]))
dim(cor_df)
```

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
heatmap.2(cor_df, Rowv = FALSE, Colv = FALSE, scale = "none", dendrogram = "none", trace = "none")
```
